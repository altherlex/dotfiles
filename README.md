dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles. Feel free to use.

.bash_aliases
-------------
Terminal shortcuts, like ".." for "cd .." and a few more.

.bash_exports
-------------
Some colors and cd path for my personal projects folder.

.bash_profile
-------------
Some magic happens here. Basically it's bash history size and my personalizations.

.gitconfig
-------------
My Git configuration (color and shotcuts). Important: I changed Git to push only the current branch.

.irbrc
-------------
For Ruby's IRB. Some libraries for optmize IRB.
